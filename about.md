## Who we are
[Malleable][malleable808] are brothers Kris and Ben Graham. 

In 2018 they set out to make livesets fun again - building an [open-source multiplayer sequencer][mseq-gitlab] using a raspberry pi, some commercially available hardware and using that at the heart of their live shows.

Modular Devices Mallebale Audio grew out of this work, and has a clear focus on producing a range of inter-operable software, cross-format devices, and utilities that are at home in the studio and in a live situation. 

Modular Devices Malleable Audio is D.I.Y & open source first - finding your own solutions to the problems, and sharing those solutions for others to build on.
