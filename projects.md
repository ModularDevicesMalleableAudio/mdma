## Projects

### MSEQ Sequencer

The [malleable 808 sequencer (or MSEQ)][malleable-808-sequencer] is an [open source project][mseq-gitlab] that brings the joy of live improvisation to livesets via the power of the MIDI protocol. 

The MSEQ is a multiplayer 11 channel polyphonic and 3 channel drum sequencer, with plentiful modulation options to sequence or add controlled randomness to sequences (CC control, duty, velocity). It has full control over swing and timing, allows for chord progressions, complex trigger conditions, and interfaces with lighting / video installations - as you can see in the live jams below:

First out of the lab, a Buchla 296e inspired filterbank / spectral transfer / vococder, using the [daisy][daisy-url] ecosystem, designed for the daisy field hardware. 

More detail, code, and videos to come!
