# Who we are
We make modular devices for audio creation, processing, and control, creating malleable audio from modular devices.

# Projects

## MSEQ Sequencer
- [documentation][malleable-808-sequencer]
- [code][mseq-gitlab]

The [malleable 808 sequencer (or MSEQ)][malleable-808-sequencer] is an [open source project][mseq-gitlab] that brings the joy of live improvisation to livesets via the power of the MIDI protocol. 

The MSEQ is a multiplayer 11 channel polyphonic and 3 channel drum sequencer, with plentiful modulation options to sequence or add controlled randomness to sequences (CC control, duty, velocity), with control over swing, chord progressions, trigger conditions, accents all available. You can see it in action below

## MFB Filterbank

First out of the lab, a Buchla 296e inspired filterbank / spectral transfer / vococder, using the [daisy][daisy-url] ecosystem, designed for the daisy field hardware.
