# MSEQ Sequencer
> The [MSEQ sequencer][malleable-808-sequencer] is an [open source project][mseq-gitlab] that brings the joy of live multiplayer improvisation to livesets via the power of the MIDI protocol. 


<img src="/mdma/assets/MSEQ.jpeg" alt="MSEQ in use" width="100%"/>

The MSEQ has an array of sequencing capabilities, including 11 polyphonic sequencers & 3 drum sequencers, as well as macro level sequencing of chord progressions and modulation options. It also sends triggers for control over lights and video. It forms the heart of our improvised livesets, and is the workhorse of our studio and because it is open source - it can power yours too!

# MSEQ Features

## Multiplayer Livesets
- Two views into the same sequencer, with two sets of controls and full visibility across all channels for both players
- Collaboration is built in, MSEQ is designed to aid improvisation between players, avoiding menu diving where possible, allowing you to focus on the jam.

## Polyphony
- 8 note polyphonic sequencing
- Multiple modulation channels to control octave and note selection per row, and over time / per trigger
- Control over rootnote and scales
- Per channel timing options - half speed / quarter speed, swing (with coarse and fine control), trigger delay

## Add complexity and variation without menu-diving
16 step sequences are great, but sometimes you need more variation. 
- MSEQ avoids scrolling through pages of sequences by implementing a range of probabilistic and conditional triggers, as well as condtional rests to enable complex variation to a pattern within 16 steps.
- Vary note length with tied notes, legato, and drones in conjunction with duty modulation using per step _and_ per trigger modulation, with attenuation controls for each
- Vary velocity in your patterns indepently per row, and per channel, with per step velocity modulation _and_ per trigger modulation, again with attenuation controls
- The attenuated Accent sequencer can be used to apply a global groove in tandem with velocity modulation for a full range of expressive and polyrythmic patterns

## Chord progressions
- Apply chord progressions to the patterns on any synth channel
- Selectively apply chord progressions to specific notes
- Chord inversions can be used with each chord progression, as well as per chord octave modulation.

## Performance features
With solid MIDI timing that ou can rely on, MSEQ is built for live. Over the years we've added more performance elements that expand what is possible within an improvised live set:
- Cue muting and unmuting of rows / drum voices / entire synths to drop in or out on the 16, or to mute / enable high pass or other FX on the 8th, 12th or 15th bar and come back in on the 16.
- Maximise expressive performance using macro controls like swapping the drums out for a 4:4 kick and offbeat hat, control mod wheels per channel, or adding a drone for a given note within one button push, or apply reverb, delay and sidechain sends on one knob per channel, or route signals to whatever hardware effects you have available.
- Stochastic autodrop feature, which can be toggled per channel, allows the sequencer to mute, apply effects or filters to channels selected at random, with a probabilistic model determining the length (quantised) and number of items to effect.
- Gated sequencer for an [Ableton push style keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8JoCwwJvOQ), allowing you to play 8-step polyphonic sequences in time with the sequencer.
- Control over the volume of every channel so you have control over the mix
- Why stop at Audio? We added a couple of modules that aggregate triggers per channel, and output midi to control lights and video mapping, to create a full reactive lightshow for our improvised livesets!
